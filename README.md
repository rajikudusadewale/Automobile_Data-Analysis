**Conclusion:**

At this point, we have gained a more comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of our data, as well as the key variables that should be considered when attempting to forecast car prices. 
Specifically, we have identified a set of continuous numerical variables, such as length, width, curb-weight,  engine-size, horsepower, city-mpg, highway-mpg, wheel-base, and bore, As well as a categorical variable, namely, drive-wheels. 

Now, we can use this to construct machine learning models to facilitate our analysis, supplying the model with relevant variables that have a genuine impact on our target variable would enhance the accuracy of our model's predictions.
